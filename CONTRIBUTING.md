## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- macOS (for testing)
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bluesound-controller.git
cd bluesound-controller

# Run installation script
./install.sh

# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_validators.py -v
```

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use descriptive variable names

### Test Requirements

- New features must include tests
- Aim for high test coverage (currently 82%)
- Tests should be fast and isolated
- Use mocking for external dependencies
